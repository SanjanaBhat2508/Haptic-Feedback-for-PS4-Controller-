Problem Addressed:
Manual PS4 controller connections were causing vehicle confusion and erratic behavior in production environments.

Solution Implemented:

i. Designed and deployed a haptic+audio feedback system.

ii. Pressing L3 in manual mode triggers a haptic buzz and audio message “Connected to vehicle,” confirming successful connection without movement.

iii. This solution reduces operational confusion and enhances manual-mode reliability, and has now been deployed to production.
